# Block and Hole
This is a project made in C ++, which is an adaptation of a Block and Hole made in 2017. It does not have a graphical interface, executed in a console.
In the project the game board is read from the text file "scenario.txt". Among the features of the game is:
  -Once the player has finished his game he can repeat the moves he has made to win
  -The PC can play without losing, although it does not do it quickly and efficiently
You can see captured images of the game
