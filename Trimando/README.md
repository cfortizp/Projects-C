# Block and Hole
This is a project made in C ++, which is an adaptation of a Block and Hole made in 2017. It does not have a graphical interface, executed in a console.

In the project the game board is read from the text file "escenario.txt". Among the features of the game is:

  - Once the player has finished his game he can repeat the moves he has made to win
  - The PC can play without losing, although it does not do it quickly and efficiently

To edit the scenario, consider the following

  - The first two lines represent the rows and columns of the game board respectively
  - (i) represents the start box where the block started vertically
  - (-) represents the gaps where the block will fall
  - (*) represents the boxes where the block can be placed
  - (g) represents the box to which the block has to arrive
